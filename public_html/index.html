            <h2>Secret Identity : Bruce Wayne</h2>
        <img src="img/wayne.png" alt="Bruce wayne" id="image">
        <p>
            Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American industrialist
            who resides just outside of Gotham City. As a child, Bruce witnessed the murder of his 
            parents, Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne, which ultimately led him to craft the Batman
            persona and seek vengeance against criminals. Wayne averts suspicion by acting the part of a
            superficial playboy idly living off his family's fortune, which was amassed through investment
            in real estate before the city became a bustling metropolis, and the profits of Wayne 
            Enterprises, his inherited conglomerate. Bruce Wayne resides just outside of Gotham City in
            Wayne Manor. He supports philanthropic causes through his nonprofit Wayne Foundation 
            but is more widely known as a celebrity socialite. In public, he appears frequently in the
            company of high-status women, which encourages tabloid gossip. Although Bruce Wayne
            leads an active romantic life, crime-fighting accounts for most of his time.
